This directory will always contain the most recent installer:
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities-Stable-1.8.0.exe

*You should ALWAYS execute option number 15 in the console interface (or the Update Scripts function of the tray icon) after installing, to ensure that the CWPU scripts are synced with the latest versions in this repository. For good measure, this function should be executed once every week or two as well.*

It will also contain a zip file for those who prefer not to use an installer (CWP Utilities is portable):
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWPU-Stable.zip

*Without the installer, you won't have the benefit of a variety of handy shortcuts, but the program can still be launched via 'CWPU-Tray.exe' or 'LauncherLauncher.bat'.*

If you need to download an old release for some crazy reason, you may check here:
